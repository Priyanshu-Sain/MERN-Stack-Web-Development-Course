* Understanding Float Concept :-
  There are two floating orientations for an element i.e. left and right
  1) If we float a child div in left orientation and float the another child in right
     orientation , toh by geometry wo dono elements/div's parallel aa jane chahiye agar 
     parent ki width se jyada width na le rhe ho toh..
     BUT, one undesirable thing happens here :-
     Jab dono elements float krke parallel aaye , toh wo geometrically to parallel aagye
     par dono elements apni z-axis pe kuch distance aage bdh gye
     Jisse ki , in elements ke parent ka plane alag hogya and in dono children ka plane alag hogya
     SO?
     -> Now , parent k andar koi child hai hi nhi..toh parent ki height kis use ki?...isliye
        "PARENT COLLAPSED"
  2) How to avoid this problem of PARENT COLLAPSING?
  -> The "CLEARFIX" method is used here to avoid this
     By clearfixing , the parent assumes that both children are stil within it but 
     ab wo 2 width na leke bss ek hi width le rhe hain..to parent height ek child ki height
     k equal ho jaygi and it will NOT COLLAPSE .

  3) Now , clearfixing karne k bhi 2 methods hain :-
     1) Parent element/div k andar two child div's hain..toh unke end me ek alag se 
        div element bana do (i.e. block element bnado) , koi text daalne ki jrurt nhi h isme
        bss block element se mtlb hai hume
        And , uski class define upar karo in <style> and make clear : both

            The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is closely
            related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species
            of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb).
